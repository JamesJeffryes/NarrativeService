Information about a workspace.

    ws_id id - the numerical ID of the workspace.
    ws_name workspace - name of the workspace.
    username owner - name of the user who owns (e.g. created) this workspace.
    timestamp moddate - date when the workspace was last modified.
    int max_objid - the maximum object ID appearing in this workspace.
        Since cloning a workspace preserves object IDs, this number may be
        greater than the number of objects in a newly cloned workspace.
    permission user_permission - permissions for the authenticated user of
        this workspace.
    permission globalread - whether this workspace is globally readable.
    lock_status lockstat - the status of the workspace lock.
    usermeta metadata - arbitrary user-supplied metadata about
        the workspace.
